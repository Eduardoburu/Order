    <div class="mavitu" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <p><strong>How the Financial Environment has changed during the Past Few Years.</strong></p>
        <p>The 2008 financial crisis had far-reaching consequences for financial institutions and markets globally. Regulatory agencies were caught unaware by the many loopholes that facilitated the risky borrowing that led to the crisis. After the crisis, regulatory agencies instituted significant changes in financial reporting that would improve the accuracy and timeliness of financial reporting.&nbsp; The lending environment has been significantly changed, and it&rsquo;s almost impossible currently for banks to approve subprime loans. The Basel committee, which is responsible for banking regulation worldwide, proposed new banking regulatory requirements that would prevent the recurrence of the same problems. Changes were made on the banking capital requirements, the liquidity levels held by banks at any one time and the leverage levels a banking institution can have at any one time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Developments that led to the 2007-2008 financial crisis</strong></p>
        <p>Subprime lending is considered to be a key development that led to the 2007-2008 financial crisis (Thakor, 2014). The housing market in the country recorded significantly high sales at the time, as more and more people resorted to home ownership plans presented by different financial institutions. As the mortgage market peaked, banks relaxed their lending requirements, leading to the approval of a high number of risky mortgages that could not be repaid by the borrowers. As more and more borrowers defaulted, banks kept losing liquidity, with some of them ultimately going halting operations. Predatory lending by certain banks is also identified as being the primary reason why borrowers failed to pay their mortgages. According to Pajarskas and Jočienė, (2014), banks took advantage of uninformed borrowers by presenting them with scrupulous loan structures, high commissions and fees and in some cases false information. Borrowers only discovered the additional charges they stood to pay after long periods of repayment with some eventually being forced to default. Lack of rigorous banking regulation at the time is also identified as being a key reason for the many undetected malpractices that led to the financial crisis. The regulatory environment at the time was not intensive and gave financial institutions too much freedom in financial reporting and the selection of underwriting practices, which was eventually abused by most of the institutions. To take advantage of the growing mortgage market, banks also borrowed heavily, regarding long-term debt, and ended up being heavily levered. Investors were not aware of these borrowings, as they were omitted from the financial statements. This led to the total collapse of some institutions, like the Lehman Brothers Inc, as they were unable to meet their debt obligations due to the liquidity crisis resulting from the crisis.</p>
        <p><strong>How and why banks suffered financial difficulties during the financial crisis</strong></p>
        <p>The banking sector suffered the most from the financial crisis. Many banks faced their worst liquidity crisis as a result of the crisis, while others were forced to file for bankruptcy or resort to mergers or acquisitions. As sales in the housing market peaked, different banks in the country kept awarding more and more mortgages. This led to an increase in subprime lending cases, where banks never carefully analyzed loan applications to ensure the borrower was actually in a position to pay the loan to completion. Borrowers soon started defaulting on payments and banks found themselves dealing with liquidity problems. Despite the best efforts of banks to ensure their investors that they were not facing a major crisis, in the end, most of them had to publicly admit that they were losing liquidity and could not be able to maintain</p>
        <p>regular operations. Major Banks in the country lost value significantly in the trading markets. Most banks had to use up their reserves in the post-crisis period to maintain operations, while others went completely under and had to be bailed out by the government.</p>
        <p><strong>Institutional participants in the mortgage markets</strong></p>
        <p>Developments in the housing market, initiated by national homebuilders led to the increase in demand for home ownership. This increased the demand for loan capital for home constructions. Real estate appraisal agencies also played a role in the crisis, and in some cases failed to provide clients with accurate valuation information on the property they intended to purchase. Banks as financial institutions played the key role in facilitating the crisis. Failure by banks to ensure all loans approved were safe and repayable by the borrower eventually led to the liquidity crisis. Finally, insurance agencies failed to properly underwrite certain mortgage applications, which contributed to subprime lending.</p>
        <p><strong>Actions that were taken by the Federal Reserve to help avoid a financial system collapse in 2008-09</strong></p>
        <p>To prevent the collapse of major sections of the financial industry in the country, the Fed put in place measures that ensured key banks remained in operation during the crisis. Institutions facing severe liquidity problems were allowed to borrow from the Fed to sustain day to day operations. Additionally, the list of possible borrowers was expanded to include institutions that do not take deposits. The Fed also directly intervened in the financial market to ensure trading was maintained during the crisis. Investors who had invested in mutual funds and held securities with some of the institutions that went under were able to borrow from the Fed and maintain operations. &nbsp;</p>
