        <p>Certain financial instruments may at one point or another have both debt and equity components, which historically presented a challenge on how to accurately account for such instruments. Since the instruments can be recorded either as a liability, an asset, or its asset and liability components can be accounted for separately. For accuracy, an ideal accounting treatment for these type of instruments should involve the separation of the asset and liability components of the instrument, which should be separately recorded in their respective asset and liability accounts. This is in line with the prudence concept of accounting, which prohibits the underestimation or overestimation of both asset and liability components of an entity&rsquo;s financial statements.</p>
        <p>According to Menk and Mies (2016), the accounting treatment of hybrid securities such as convertible bonds has always been a challenge for both the company issuing the instrument and the investor purchasing it. Accounting separately for the asset and liability components of hybrid securities aids greatly in reducing these challenges. A company using this method can be more assured of the accuracy of their financial statements, as both its assets and liabilities have not been over or understated. The recognition of hybrid securities exclusively as either assets or liabilities can have unexpected effects on a company that may need review (PWC, 2017). While preparing financial statements, the asset and liability values of hybrid securities should be split and recorded separately as at the balance sheet date. This improves the accuracy of financial statements, as the asset values of the instrument is recorded as it keeps increasing with time, and the liability value reduced accordingly. &nbsp;</p>
