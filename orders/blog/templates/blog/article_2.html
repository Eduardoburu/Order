        <p>Transfer prices are rates at which different internal divisions within the same company trade with each other. In most manufacturing organizations, different divisions manufacture different components that when assembled, for the complete product. To effectively measure the performance of each division, prices are usually set that are used as means of measuring the profit generated by each division, after determining the revenues generated and the costs incurred. Due to the need for divisional managers to ensure that their departments are performing according to expectations, transfer prices are usually almost similar to the market prices of the respective components being transferred.</p>
        <p>The primary purpose of transfer pricing in an organization is to gauge the performance of each division within a company (Heath, Huddart, &amp; Slotta, 2009). Transfer pricing enables divisional managers to know the value of other departments within the same company since transfer pricing decisions within the firm impact on the performance of all divisions in a company&rsquo;s production line. The determination of the profits and loses contributed by each department within a company also enables the leadership in an organization to identify operational strengths and weaknesses that can be used as a basis for determining ways through which overall performance can be improved. Divisions that are performing efficiently may be allocated more resources, while those underperforming are reviewed and corrective measures put in place.</p>
        <p>Transfer prices are not real, and there is no actual movement of money or any other consideration among the divisions in a company. The rates are instead agreed upon by managers and divisional managers and used to assess the financial performance of each division in the financial year. Transfer prices do not usually feature in financial statements meant for external use, but are mainly intended for internal use by managers. A transfer pricing policy is also used as an incentive to divisional managers to ensure their divisions operate efficiently. Since the performance of each division is analyzed during the year, divisional managers are more likely to exercise more caution in the management of costs of production, to ensure their divisions end up being profit centers at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Several different alternatives can be used when setting transfer prices. Market-based transfer prices are based on the prevailing market prices of components being transferred from one division to another. Secondly, negotiated transfer prices can be used where divisional managers agree on the rates to be used. The production cost of the components to be transferred can also be used as a basis for setting transfer prices, where either the full cost of manufacture or the variable costs is charged to the division receiving the component. Dual transfer prices can also be used, which charge lower prices based on marginal costs to the buying division, but selling division records the sale at the total cost of the component transferred.</p>
        <p>Special taxation policies are usually applied in cases where organizations are transferring products to a foreign division.&nbsp; This allows the company to pay less tax on the products being imported, as they are valued at a lower amount than would have been the case had they been imported from an independent supplier (Liu, Schmidt-Eisenlohr, &amp; Guo, 2017). As a result, different governments have signed transfer pricing agreements that discourage the use of transfer pricing as a tax avoidance method.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, transfer pricing is an essential managerial accounting function, which enables management to evaluate the performance of different divisions within a company and identify ways of improving the overall performance of the company. Through transfer pricing, an organization can improve the efficiency of internal processes and procedures as each divisions performance is analyzed and key strengths and weaknesses identified.</p>
