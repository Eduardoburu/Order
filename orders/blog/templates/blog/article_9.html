        <p>The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation was officially created in 1989 by twenty-one countries in the Asia Pacific region as a way of encouraging trade within the region and strengthening the economic and investment environment among the member states (APEC, 2017). The forum seeks to liberalize trade among the member states in the region and remove barriers that reduced the volume and magnitude of trade among the member states. Among other things, the agreement resulted in mutual concessions by member states on the trade of different items. Additionally, new institutional frameworks were put in place as a result of the forums initiatives that were tasked with the identification of the ways of improving trade within the region and boosting economic growth.&nbsp; This paper analyzes the origin, development, achievements, and failures of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and changes it has undergone as a result of the changing economic and political environment.</p>
        <p><strong>Origin and Role</strong></p>
        <p>The first meeting among prospective members of the cooperation was held in Canberra in 1989 on the invitation of the presiding Australian premiere at the time (APEC, 2017). The foundations of the forums cooperation were established at this initial meeting, and members present agreed to hold future meetings at different venues in future. Several countries opposed the creation of the forum at the time, instead advocating for a more inclusive forum that would allow members outside the Asia Pacific region to participate. The creation of the cooperation was finalized eventually, and the first meeting of economic experts within the region was held in 1993 (APEC, 2017). Since then, the forum has grown to its current</p>
        
        <p>state and has twenty-one member states at the moment. The criteria for admission specifies members should be independent economies, irrespective of their independence as a state, and three independent observer states oversee its activities.</p>
        <p>The forum&rsquo;s central role is the promotion of free trade within the region by removing or working around barriers to trade that historically existed among the member states. The forum has successfully done this, and the cost of business among most of the countries in the cooperation has significantly been reduced. According to its official website (2017), the forum has resulted in the reduction of tariff barriers considerably among member states and has resulted in an increase of trade volumes among member states by $20 trillion. Additionally, the forum has in place planned measures that would further reduce the costs of trade within the region and has introduced visa-free travel for business purposes among the member states. Through the forum, cooperation with non-member states by member states has also significantly improved.</p>
        <p><strong>Achievements</strong></p>
        <p>The forum has been able to successfully change the trade environment within the member states and boost intraregional trade. The cooperation strengthens regional trade among the member states by tackling tariff barriers which limit the entry and exit of goods at border points (APEC, 2017). Ways through which the economic environment and capacity of individual member states can be improved are developed and implemented by cooperation with the assistance of other member states. As a result of the cooperation&rsquo;s initiatives, cross-border trade within the region has increased significantly and common problems experienced by business people in moving products to neighboring countries have been done away with. Through the efforts</p>
        <p>of the cooperation, open trade has grown rapidly within the region as has economic development and the levels of investment among the member states.</p>
        <p>Individually, member states have benefitted from the cooperation&rsquo;s initiatives aimed at boosting their respective institutional frameworks designed to promote trade. Before the inception of the collaboration, several member states within the region had not adequately developed vital institutions and organizations that were tasked with ensuring business within and outside the country was conducted as efficiently as possible (DFAT, 2017). Through the intervention of the cooperation, members states have improved their capacity tremendously and can now handle trades both inside and outside much more efficiently. The private sector in each member country has also benefited as a result of the cooperation. Through the business advisory council established by the forum, industries within the region have been developed by different initiatives put in place by the cooperation aimed at improving the capacity of the private sector in conducting business throughout the region.</p>
        <p><strong>Failures</strong></p>
        <p>Despite its successes, APEC has failed to meet several of its set goals and targets and still lags behind in overseeing the completion of critical projects and milestones agreed in previous meetings. In the 1994 conference, officials and leaders of the cooperation established several goals that were intended to be met by the years 2010 and 2020, commonly referred to as the Bogor goals. Part of the Bogor goals included achieving a specified degree of free trade within the region by the year 2010 and creating highly developed individual economies by the year 2020, both of which have not been achieved (Jumilla, 2014). Collective efforts by the member states and</p>
        <p>the cooperation have not been able to entirely do away with critical trade barriers that limit trade among member states. Projections also indicate that the collaboration is not on course to meet the national development goals by the year 2020 (Jumilla, 2014).</p>
        <p>APEC is also criticized for its failure to tackle critical issues within the region that indirectly and sometimes directly impact on trade among the member states (Jumilla, 2014). Critical issues such as terrorism and high levels of corruption within some member states have significantly limited the economic growth of some member states. APEC rarely discusses these issues in detail and instead shifts the responsibility to member states who may not have the requisite capacity to adequately tackle these problems. This has contributed to the failure of the cooperation to achieve planned economic development goals in individual member states as agreed upon in several meetings. Regarding trade, the forum has focused more attention on tariff barriers, leading to an increase of non-tariff barriers that also significantly limit trade within the region (APEC, 2016).</p>
        <p><strong>Strengths and Limitations </strong></p>
        <p>APEC is one of the oldest multilateral trade cooperation in the world. With only twelve members in 1989 at its inception, the cooperation has attracted different countries within and outside the Asia Pacific region to become one of the most significant economic cooperative association among independent states. The corporation&rsquo;s main strengths lie in its diversity of membership, from developed nations like the United States and Japan to developing countries like Chile and Peru. Most of the countries in the cooperation are actively involved in trade and therefore benefit greatly from the cooperation. The diversity of membership also encourages</p>
        <p>the movement of capital from developed nations to developing nations by way of foreign direct investment. Industries in developed countries are also able to find markets for their products in different member states at a lower cost than in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>The diversity of membership also creates income inequalities as some states within the cooperation end up getting less than other trade partners and therefore find harder to comply with tariff changes requirements by the cooperation. As a result, the cooperation makes slow progress towards the achievement of the proposed free trade area that will feature the elimination of all trade barriers. Some of the proposed policies by the cooperation end up conflicting with national laws of some member states (Jumilla, 2014). A situation which forces the member states to make adjustments to their internal rules and in some cases fail to comply entirely with the requirements of the cooperation.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact of the ongoing power realignment in the region on the functioning and the agenda of APEC.</strong></p>
        <p>Changes in power structures within the region have adversely affected APEC&rsquo;s agenda in the recent past. APEC&rsquo;s main plan has been the creation of a Free Trade Area in the Asia Pacific (FTAAP), an agreement that would significantly diminish existing trade barriers within the region (Aggarwal, 2006). This agenda is however delayed by political differences among crucial member states in the cooperation. Aggarwal (2006), identifies the emergence of China as a superpower recently as one of the reasons it is highly unlikely that a multilateral trade agreement will be signed that will involve the United States, China, and Russia. Aggarwal (2006) also notes that the</p>
        
        <p>United States is unlikely to enter into any multilateral trade agreement irrespective of the parties involved due to its existing bilateral trade agreements. The rapid growth of China as an economic powerhouse has not been well received in the United States political scene (Bergsten, 2007),</p>
        <p>Meaning the probability that the US Senate will agree to multilateral trade agreement involving China is low.</p>
        <p>Recent political dissension between the United States and Russia over its policies on Crimea may also factor in when pushing for the cooperation between both countries.</p>
        <p>The functioning of the cooperation has also been affected by the changes in the economic situation of some member countries. According to Goldstone (2014), the creation of the APEC significantly improved relations between China and the United States, although competing interests between the two nations in a way limit the functioning of the cooperation&rsquo;s agenda. Both the United States and China seeks economic and political dominance in the Asia Pacific region and continuously engage with non-member states in a bid to bolster their influence, sometimes in disregard of APEC&rdquo;s best interests.</p>
        <p><strong>The decline of US economic hegemony in the region and the utility of the APEC format for maintenance of US leadership and the Asia-Pacific economic integration process.</strong></p>
        <p>Over time, the United States interests in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation have declined (Aggarwal, 2006). Of late the United States has shown more interest in the maintenance of bilateral and sectorial agreements that are already in place and has not shown significant interest in the entering a multilateral free trade agreement as proposed by APEC. The growth of China as an economic powerhouse in the region has reduced</p>
        
        <p>significantly the influence that the United States has in the area. Additionally, competing interests between the United States and China have negatively affected the implementation of critical APEC agendas. The US though remains an active member of the cooperation and contributes to policy making and implementation where necessary.</p>
        <p>APEC has over time come to be recognized as being essential to the economic development of the Asia Pacific region. Evidently, the cooperation has been instrumental in the improvement of cross-border trade among different countries within the region. Industries within member states have also benefited from various initiatives put in place by the cooperation to improve their capacity to trade efficiently within the region. Member states, therefore, expect more from APEC regarding trade liberalization. According to Dent (2008), member states within the region hope the initiatives of the cooperation will result in further reduction in transaction costs for cross-border trades among member states and will stimulate foreign direct investments to the region from other parts of the world. In general, APEC is expected to spur economic development in the region through trade liberalization.</p>
        <p><strong>The Possibility of China Monopolizing APEC due to Weakening US Interests. </strong></p>
        <p>China growth to become one of the most influential states in the Asia Pacific region has resulted in declining US interests in pursuing APEC&rsquo;s key plans and policies. The finalization of the Free Trade Area for the Asia Pacific region (FTAAP) agreement is widely viewed as being opposed to individual bilateral trade agreements that the US already has in place. In the 2014 APEC general meeting, the United States agreed to support the Beijing backed FTAAP agreement, and up to date has not</p>
        
        <p>withdrawn its support (BBC, 2014). This shows that the United States is still actively involved in policy making at the cooperation, and intends to find alternative solutions to the rival trade agreement to the FTAAP. The possibility of China, therefore, monopolizing processes at APEC and taking steps that would primarily serve its interests is quite insignificant. The United States remains influential in the region even in spite of China&rsquo;s growing influence (Bergsten, 2007). The interests of the United States are therefore not likely to be preceded by those of China and its allies in future. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>APEC has been instrumental in the elimination of trade barriers and tariffs that used to discourage cross-border trade as a result of the high costs involved and complicated procedures and processes. Through the efforts of the cooperation, it is now less expensive and relatively easier for business people to trade with different countries within the cooperation. Initiatives by the cooperation have also been valuable in improving the industrial performance of individual member states and boosting the capacity of business to be able to trade within the region. Additionally, APEC has stimulated economic growth within the region and improved cooperation among member states.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, APEC will not be significantly affected by the newly developed policy of rival regionalism in the Asia Pacific region. APEC&rsquo;s goals and objectives are clearly focused on the promotion of a much more liberal trading environment. This is more focused than rival regionalism as a policy, which seeks to address several different issues, Both APEC and the newly proposed regional integration initiatives aim to liberalize trade, and therefore can only be mutually exclusive regarding their selected methods; otherwise they advocate for the same goals and objectives and can consequently coexist.</p>
