    <div class="mavitu" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <p>Wells Fargo is one of the largest financial services firms in the world and has been ranked consistently as one of the largest financial institutions worldwide in terms of its market value. As a holding company, the firm provides different financial services through its various subsidiaries worldwide. The bank also has one of the largest asset bases in the financial services industry, and its brand is recognized as one of the most valuable in the world (Forbes 1). The bank was formed in 1852 as a local bank in the state of California and has grown tremendously over the years to become the second largest bank in the United States and a respected international brand in the financial services industry (Wells Fargo 1). In 2016, the company was rocked by one of its worst internal financial scandal in its existence. Employees within the organization repeatedly created fake accounts in the names of its customers to keep up with pressure from management to increase revenues.&nbsp; This paper analyzes the effects of the issue on the company, and steps that could have been taken by management to prevent it.</p>
        <p>Like most other financial services firms, Wells Fargo experienced declining revenues after the 2008 financial crisis. Although not as badly hit as other banks, the company struggled to increase revenues in years following the crisis. Managers at the bank were under immense pressure to increase revenue to not only insulate the bank from the effects of the crisis but to ensure its brand value remains intact. As a result, managers imposed quite high sales targets on their employees in a bid to increase revenues (Cowley 1). A section of employees within the company that could not be able to meet the sales goals resorted to creating fake customer accounts under the names of existing customers so as to maintain a favorable performance record. The fake accounts were undetectable by other staff at the bank and stayed in operation until customers started noticed additional banking charges on their accounts. A series of investigations led to the discovery of more than 2 million fake accounts created in the names of existing clients by the bank's staff. The brand value of the company suffered immensely as a result of the scandal. In addition to losing customers, the company was fined more than $185 million by regulatory agencies and spent an additional $142 million in settling a class action suits by customers (Cowley 1).</p>
        <p>The scandal could have been prevented had the company selected a less aggressive method of raising revenues. Managers at the firm pushed employees to the limit and ended up forcing them to use any means necessary to increase the revenues of the company. Nonethical employees resorted to illegal means to meet targets and safeguard their position within the company, by forcing customers to pay for non-existing accounts. The efficiency of internal control systems within the company was also to blame as the scandal went on undetected for longer than necessary in the case of one of the most sophisticated banks in the world. The company, therefore, needs to improve internal checks and balances that would prevent the recurrence of such an issue. The company also needs to stress on ethics internally and the need for employees to maintain high integrity even when facing immense pressure.</p>
