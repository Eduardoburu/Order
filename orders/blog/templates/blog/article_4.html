        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>The complete ban on the use of cellphones while driving has been a contentious topic that has attracted a great deal of debate on how useful it is as a means of reducing road accidents. In the United States, most states have certain restrictions on the use cellphones while driving, but no state has in place a complete ban. According to Sacco, the adverse effects of the use of cell phones while driving are usually downplayed by government agencies, but in reality, the number of accidents attributed to cellphone use while driving has been on a steady increase (1).&nbsp; A complete ban on cellphone use while driving can be instrumental in improving the concentration of drivers on the road and as a result reduce the number of accidents related to cell phone use while driving.</p>
        <p><strong>Cellphone use while Driving and Possible Effects</strong></p>
        <p>Regulatory agencies usually make a distinction between different ways in which a cellphone can result in distracted driving. According to McCartt, Kidd, and Teoh, instances of distracted driving are high when drivers dial and hold cellphones to their ears while driving (1). Drivers are also highly distracted when reading and sending text messages while driving. The use of handsfree devices results in less distraction and is not considered as a major problem for drivers. Hand-held cellphone use is deemed to be a key contributor to distracted driving and consequently the cause of many accidents. Handheld cell phone use is associated with most of the accident cases that result from distracted driving.</p>
        <p>Driving while using a phone, either in hands-free mode or while holding the phone forces a driver to multitask and concentrate on both the cellphone conversation and their driving at the same time. As a result, a driver may end up getting distracted. An analysis of brain activity when drivers use phones when driving showed that cell phone use is likely to result in lost concentration on driving by more than 30% (Saifuzzaman, Haque and Zheng, 3). This may cause the driver to fail to process visual recognition by a driver properly. Their brains may not immediately process some of the objects they see before them due to the engagement caused by cellphone use. As a result, a driver can get highly distracted by cell phone use while driving to the point of failing to see objects in their way or turns and winding curves by roads, which may lead to an accident eventually.</p>
        <p>Cellphone use when driving is a major cause of distracted driving, and should, therefore, be addressed more seriously if the number of accidents it causes are to be reduced. As the number of cellphone use increases, cases of distracted driving as a result of cellphone use are bound to increase. It can be assumed that close to all drivers on the road at any one time have their cellphone with them, and can use it at any time where there are no legal restrictions on their use. According to studies carried out by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, about 7% of drivers within the United States are using cell phones at any one</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>time of the day (4). Young people are particularly at greater risk of getting into accidents caused by cell phone use due to their low-risk perception of the negative effects of cellphone use while driving.</p>
        <p>The impact of the use of hands-free technology in the reduction of road accidents resulting from distracted driving as a result of cellphone use when driving is not significant (Saifuzzaman, Haque and Zheng,4). Even when a drive is using hands-free technology to avoid holding a cellphone in their hands, at one point or another, they will have to reach the phone when accepting a call, ending one or while reading text messages. This can be equally dangerous as a driver may get engaged on the cellphone for longer than they had hoped and end up losing focus on the road an having an accident.</p>
        <p>While using cellphones, drivers also tend to blindly follow the vehicle in front of them, without paying close attention to the road and the objects on the road. As a result, there is a possibility that a driver may fail to adequately adjust their driving to avoid objects that they were unable to see as a result of the vehicle in front of them. Irrespective of whether they were using handsfree or not, this can still lead to an accident.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>Cellphone use while driving cause distractions to drivers that can lead to accidents. With the growing numbers of people using cell phones, the number of drivers using cell phones when driving at any one time in increasing. Regulatory agencies, on the other hand, have not put in place effective laws that restrict the use of cellphones when driving. Within the United States, several states have laws that partially restrict the use of cellphones while driving, mostly for underage drivers. A complete ban on the use of cellphones while driving can be instrumental in reducing the numbers of accidents resulting from distracted driving as a result of cellphone use.</p>
