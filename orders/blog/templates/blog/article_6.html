    <div class="mavitu" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>The ability to complain effectively can come in handy in situations where a person needs to address specific issues that they feel are not in line with their expectations. Being able to raise awareness on specific issues and address them in a consultative manner is of vital importance in resolving problems or challenges that one may face in the course of their life. To efficiently complain, one must know exactly what they hope to achieve in the ensuing discussion and how to present their facts in ways that will support their arguments. Arguments presented should be based on facts and avoiding inconsistent statements that have no basis is critical in ensuring that one is understood and stand a chance of getting their desired result. The following is a step by step guide on how effectively present one&rsquo;s arguments in a complaint.</p>
        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine the goals and objectives that the complaint intends to achieve. Knowing the desired result of the complaint makes it easier to find and use information that creates arguments that will most lean towards the intended goal or objective (Stack 1). This also aids in avoiding confusing arguments that can lead towards a different outcome than one expected. The review of the complaint by the person who receives it is also more straightforward if it is tied to a specific goals or objective.</li>
            <li>Check on the validity of the complaint to be sure nothing has been missed, and there is indeed some form of discrepancy in place. A reasonable complaint is based on valid facts that have been verified by the person making the complaint. Complaints should be based on one or more concrete reasons that can be explained clearly without leaving out anything. Invalid complaints based on perceived or nonfactual information achieve little, meaning a complainant needs to collect as much information as possible to support their claim.</li>
            <li>Determine the right person to direct the complaint to. Addressing a complaint to the right person guarantees instant results (Selig 1). Depending on the setting, the right person to resolve a complaint may or may not be the most senior person in place. Influence can be crucial in determining how a complaint will be handled. In group situations, addressing a complaint to the most influential person in the group is more efficient than strictly following the chain of command in place.</li>
            <li>Gather sufficient information to ensure the complaint is made from a well-informed point of view on issues being addressed. Each complaint is usually influenced by situational factors that the complainant needs to be well aware of when making the complaint. In addition to the hard rules in place that can impact on the outcome of the complaint, the complainant should be aware of situational factors that may have led to the state of affairs that is currently in place. All factors that led to the current state of affairs that in the end resulted in the complaint need to be analyzed by the complainant before making the complaint.</li>
            <li>Ensure the complaint is as reasonable and polite as possible. Emotional discussions should be avoided at all costs, and arguments made should be factual and based on verified information. Foul language and outbursts that may be deemed as rude should be avoided as they may sway persons in authority into believing the complaint has no reasonable cause. Additionally, politeness makes communication easier as both parties can understand each other well and make clarifications as need be.</li>
            <li>Point to specific facts and persons in your arguments for clarity. The complaint should be about a particular state of affairs, occasioned by specific policies or persons that should be pointed out in the complaint. Vagueness as to who is responsible for the state of affairs leading to the complaint makes it difficult to address the issue correctly.</li>
            <li>Provide opportunities for clarifications and replies on matters that you may not be aware of. Despite the fact that all required information was gathered before the complaint was made, there might still be some information that was missed while making the complaint. Opportunities should, therefore, be provided for clarification on matters that the complainant was not aware of.</li>
            <li>End the complaint on a positive note. The complaint should be finished on a positive note that creates room for deliberation and the weighing of information presented to reach a decision. Hardline stances and judgments should be avoided as they limit the flexibility of the decisions made regarding the complaint.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success or failure of a complaint is determined by how specific issues in the complaint were addressed as the complaint was made. The collection of necessary information that will support critical arguments is vital and ensures that the complaint is made on a factual basis and is free of bias. Complaints should also be based on reasonable grounds and should be presented politely. Opportunities should be provided for clarifications and time given for the final solution.&nbsp;</p>
