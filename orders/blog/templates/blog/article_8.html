        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>Culture is widely believed to be associated with poverty. Culture as a way of life, impacts on the belief, attitudes and work ethics of people and consequently factors in when determining the success that people can have. According to Seabrook (2014), people&rsquo;s culture as a set of values and norms ends up determining their attitudes and beliefs about work, which impacts on their productivity. Poverty also has implications on culture to a great extent (McCabe, 2015). People who continually live in poverty may experience slowed growth and development of their culture and are more likely to accept retrogressive cultural practices in comparison to people with steady incomes. Poverty affects different aspects of the life of people in a particular culture including their education, access to employment, family units and general outlook towards life. This paper analyzes specific ways through which poverty distorts cultural values and reinforces retrogressive practices and beliefs.</p>
        <p><strong>Effects of Poverty on a Culture</strong></p>
        <p>One of the fundamental ways through which poverty affects culture is through its impact on education. People living in poverty usually have fewer opportunities to get a quality education in comparison to those whose families have steady incomes. By limiting the ability of people in a specific culture to get a quality education, the development of that culture is also significantly limited. In general, education creates numerous opportunities for people in a particular culture to improve their lives, get exposed to new information and many different opportunities.</p>
        <p>Failure to get a quality education means people in a specific culture remain dependent on the same if not fewer opportunities that their parents had. As a result, cultural values and beliefs that may be unprogressive are retained instead of being changed. In a study conducted by McCabe (2015) on African Americans living in poverty, it was determined that the failure to access quality education forces African Americans to retain retrogressive cultural values and beliefs that in the long run end up being harmful. The study intended to determine the response of African Americans living in poverty to their failure to get a quality education like other in society. Findings indicated that uneducated black men and women often resorted to stereotypical behavior usually identified with black people in America, which in most cases is negative and has little positive benefits. This means the failure to acquire quality education as a result of poverty results in cultural backwardness, as people in a specific culture fail to get new opportunities that come with information that can lead to cultural improvements.</p>
        <p>Cultural improvement is also slowed in situations where the majority of people do not have access to a steady income and cannot find opportunities that can lead to productive lives. According to Seabrook (2014), the assumption that it is cultural values and practices that led to poverty may be misconstrued. He argues that the opposite may be true, poverty leads to the adoption of cultural values and beliefs that are unprogressive and self-defeating. It is usually assumed that specific cultural values and practices typically lead to attitudes that do not favor development, and as a result, people in such a culture end living in poverty continuously for long</p>
        <p>periods of time until a change in culture takes place. Seabrook (2014), on the other hand, argues that it is poverty that strengthens retrogressive cultural practices that limit development.</p>
        <p>As a result of poverty, people in a particular culture may find it hard to get into gainful employment, which in turn forces them to settle for opportunities available to them that may be negative. McCabe (2015), also supports this notion. In a study conducted to determine the causes of adverse stereotypical behaviors associated with African Americans in the US, it was determined that the inability to find good jobs convinces most black people that they can only do well in careers associated with uneducated blacks living in the country. Some of which are not illegal and may lead to dangerous behaviors. Opportunities to gainful employment would lead to more knowledge and new opportunities that would with time erase harmful activities backed by a culture that is associated with a particular people. People usually adapt to the culture around them as they grow up. Where the culture is positive and encourages development, people will grow up with a growth focused mentality and will look out for different opportunities to improve their lives. Where the culture is negative and is focused on survival more than development as is the case where poverty is, people may not aggressively look out for new opportunities for growth and may end up being complacent with their current situation. For example, children who see their parents living on welfare grow up believing welfare is a viable option for survival (McCabe, 2015).</p>
        <p>Poverty also interferes with the organization of culture based institutions in society such as family units and marriage. According to a study conducted by the University of Michigan (2017), there is a high prevalence of early marriages and teenage pregnancies among people living in poverty in different cultures. This results in a culture of young parents that in most cases do not have the financial capacity to take care of their children properly. Additionally, early marriage and teenage pregnancies usually result in termination of education, further limiting the growth and development of people in a specific culture, which in turn slows the development of that culture. In most cases, these early marriages do not survive for long, which results in single parenting and the disintegration of the family unit as it usually is in most cultures.</p>
        <p>Poverty also backs cultural values and beliefs that limit people&rsquo;s aspirations and attitudes about their future. According to McCabe (2015) most people who grow up in poverty end up underachieving and living in situations that they could have avoided if they had better attitudes and aspirations about their future. When a person grows up in poverty, they are more inclined to settle for opportunities that are available in their immediate environment and ignore opportunities that may exist elsewhere in society. This limits their growth and forces them to settle for opportunities that may not match their abilities. This greatly impacts on cultural development and further reinforces cultural stereotypes associated with specific cultures. Tackling poverty therefore within a specific culture in the long-term results in sustainable development and improvements in the entire culture.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Experience on the Effects of Poverty on a Culture</strong></p>
        <p>As a young child growing up in Mexico, I had to quit school and take up work to help out in the family. This further sheds light on what people in my culture and in other go through in a bid to boost their income and live comfortably. Despite the fact the people in society were aware of the fact that schooling is more important than working at an early age, they had to compromise and live with the consequences, which further shows how the need for income can distort cultural values and beliefs.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>Poverty adversely affects culture. Cultural progression and consequently the progression of its people is substantially limited as a result of poverty. One way this happens is through limited educational opportunities, which prevents people from competing on fairgrounds with those who are well educated, and therefore have access to fewer opportunities. Additionally, poverty limits the ability of people in a given culture to create gainful employment and as a result, create new opportunities that can be used to grow their culture positively. People living in poverty are also less likely to believe they can access better opportunities and as a result may end up settling for opportunities that are locally available to them. This limits their development and consequently the development of their culture. Poverty also interferes with family units. People living in poverty are more likely to resort to early marriages and have a high prevalence of teenage pregnancies. This lead to distorted family units and in the end reinforces negative cultural beliefs and values about a culture. For a culture to grow and change over time for the benefit of its people, poverty must be dealt with by its people. The slow reduction of poverty results in new opportunities and information that can create cultural changes that will benefit people in a particular culture for the long term</p>
