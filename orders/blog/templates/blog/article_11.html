    <div class="mavitu" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <p><strong>Definitions of Employee Engagement and Motivation</strong></p>
        <p>The need for corporations to have highly engaged and motivated employees as a prerequisite for their success features prominently in organizational behavior and human resource management literature. Different definitions focus on the various approaches or views on the application of employee engagement and motivation in an organization. According to Mirvis (2012), employee engagement refers to the extent to which employees in an organization are passionate about their work and how this influences their work behavior. According to Abraham (2012), employee motivation refers to the drive that employees have while doing their job as a result of the level of satisfaction that they have in their work. According to Breevaart, et al. (2013), employee engagement is a product of the level of intrinsic motivation an employee has at any given time. Employees with high intrinsic motivation are more engaged in their jobs and perform better. According to Cerasoli &amp; Nicklin (2014), the level of employee engagement in their careers is a product of both their intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as determined by their work environment. He, Zhu, and Zheng (2014) view employee engagement and motivation as being a product of workplace justice, determined by the fairness with which management handles different issues in the organization. They note that employees tend to be more engaged and motivated where workplace justice is high. It is clear from these definitions that employee motivation and engagement are complementary and cannot exist exclusively in an organization. Well motivated employees are more likely to be highly involved in their work and produce at a high level.</p>
        <p><strong>Research Approaches From Selected Sources</strong></p>
        <p>In an analysis that seeks to determine the existence of job satisfaction as a requirement for high job engagement, Abraham (2012), samples 30 employees from a population 120 employees in a private insurance company. The sample was then required to complete a questionnaire which identifies 25 job satisfaction traits and 12 job engagement traits. A correlation analysis was then done to determine the relationship between job satisfaction and employee engagement. The research discovered there was a high correlation between job satisfaction and job engagement.</p>
        <p>Cerasoli and Nicklin (2014) collected data over a 40 year period to determine whether extrinsic motivation provided by management reduces self-motivation by employees. The performance of employees in the sample population was analyzed by differentiating their attitudes towards incentives that were provided by organizational managers and personal incentives that were intrinsic to each employee. The research determined that in no way does extrinsic motivation interfere with intrinsic motivation. Organizational incentives only motivated employees to the extent that they facilitated the achievement of other goals not related to their current environment at the workplace.</p>
        <p>He, Zhu, and Zheng (2014) sought to determine the relationship between employee motivation and engagement and the fairness of internal processes and procedures in an organization. An online survey was created for employees in a large service organization and more than 200 responses collected. A scale was used to determine the level of employee engagement in the organization that featured questions which required employees to either agree or disagree with specific statements about the organization. A similar scale was used to measure the level of procedural justice within the organization. A correlation analysis was then done to determine the relationship between the two variables. The research concluded that employee engagement was high in cases where employees were of the opinion that the internal organizational processes and procedures were just.</p>
        <p>Mirvis (2012), sought to determine the level of employee engagement in organizations that practiced corporate social responsibility in comparison to those that did not. The study viewed employee engagement as either being transactional, relational or developmental. In a transactional approach, employees are rigorously involved in company program and interest. A relational approach involved analyzing how employees responded to corporate social responsibility of their company and lastly, a developmental approach examined how organization tried to get their employees interested in corporate social responsibilities of the company. The study determined that employees were highly engaged in corporate social responsibility programs of their employers and showed a keen interest in the values and beliefs of their employer.</p>
        <p>Breevaart et al. (2013), analyzed the relationship between leadership methods and employee engagement. The study mainly focused on transactional leadership, effective reward management and positive discrimination and how they impacted on the level of employee engagement in an organization. The study sampled 61 enlisted officers in the army who completed a series of questionnaires over a 40 day period. From the data collected by the questionnaires, measures were used to determine the extent of perceived effectiveness in leadership, positive discrimination, recognition of excellent performance and employee engagement. A correlation analysis was then used to determine the level of association among the variables. It was determined that effective leadership, positive discrimination, and proper reward management resulted in high employee engagement.</p>
        <p><strong>Application of Employee Engagement and Motivation in Industry</strong></p>
        <p>Employee engagement and motivation plays a significant role in the determination of the productivity of each employee. According to Cole, Walter, Bedeian, &amp; O&rsquo;Boyle (2012), employee engagement determines the attitudes with which employee approach their work and consequently their productivity and other factors such as burnout. Corporate managers are encouraged to keep devising ways through which they can maintain a high level of motivation in their organization and ensure that employees are always sufficiently engaged. Effective motivation, and hence employee engagement starts with ensuring that employees are capable of performing highly in the roles they are assigned (Cherian &amp; Jacob, 2013). This means the recruitment and selection of employees should be done in a way that ensures an organization selects employees who are capable and self-sufficient to perform effectively with minimum support from management.</p>
        <p>Employee engagement is also crucial to the success and growth of a business organization. In research conducted by AON (2012), it was determined that an increase of 5% in the engagement of employees in organizational activities usually translates into a 3% increase in the financial results of trading companies. This means engagement drives innovation which in the long run translates to growth. Highly engaged employees in the workplace usually as a result of good leadership also aid an organization in attracting highly talented employees by portraying a company as an ideal employer (Wang &amp; Hsieh, 2013). Highly engaged employees contribute to the overall reputation of an organization and aid in making it a preferred workplace for prospective employees. It is crucial however that future research studies identify more ways through which corporate leaders can efficiently get their employees engaged in the day to day activities of an organization.</p>
        <p><strong>How Findings From This Research Can Aid Me Be An Effective Manager</strong></p>
        <p>As a manager, it will be of critical importance to identify ways that can be used to ensure that employees are well motivated and engaged in their work. The finding of this research provides an excellent foundation on how exactly to get employees involved and engaged in their work for high productivity. According to Shuck and Reio (2014), one way of achieving this is to ensure that employees have enough autonomy in their work that enables them to function independently and be as innovative as possible in their roles. Ensuring that there are proper contextual factors within the work environment such as enough resources, reasonable demands and the availability of challenges from time to time also improves the engagement and performance of employees in an organization (Petrou, Demerouti, Peeters, Schaufeli, &amp; Hetland, 2012).</p>
        <p>As a manager, it is also essential to identify practical ways of motivating employees given the nature of their work and their position within the organization. This requires matching skills and ability between an employee and their job descriptions, which reduces work stress and enhances their commitment to the organization (Ferneta, Austina, &amp; Vallerand, 2012). Also, the direct involvement of employees in decision making is instrumental in not only ensuring the organization gets the best out of them, but they also get to feel more appreciated and valued by the organization and therefore get more committed. Continuous dialogue on critical issues regarding work processes can also be instrumental in identifying bottlenecks in the work environment that reduce employee productivity, which eventually leads to a more productive work environment which contributes to productivity.</p>
