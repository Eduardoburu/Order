    <div class="mavitu" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <p>Cuisines are specialized types of cooking that involve the use of specific methods and ingredients. Cuisines are usually associated with specific cultures and regions. Food choices and culinary trends are usually determined by the available ingredients in a particular geographic region or culture. According to Kwon (2015, p.1), ethnic cuisines are associated with specific ethnic groups, developed through the consistent use of specific ingredients widely available in an area occupied by the ethnic group. With time, specific dishes become common to a particular ethnic group. A cuisine is considered to be ethnic if it ends up being acceptable to people outside of the ethnic group that originally developed the cuisine. Several international cuisines served worldwide today are associated with certain ethnic groups, including the Indian cuisines, Korean cuisines and Italian cuisines (Kwon, 2015, p.1). The development of ethnic foods is primarily determined by the availability of key ingredients that go into the preparation of the specific cuisine. Usually, ethnic cuisines are developed as a result of the wide availability of required ingredients in areas occupied by a specific ethnic group.</p>
        <p>According to Rush (2015, p.1), each country usually has a specific dish that is widely popular among its people. Like ethnic cuisines, national cuisines depend on the availability of key ingredients for use in the cuisine. National cuisines are dishes that have found popularity in other parts of the world in addition to their home country. According to Ferguson (2010, p.104), professional training is not responsible for the development of national cuisines, but their development is the result of consistent preparation by the majority of the people in a country. A global cuisine, on the other hand, is one that has gained global acceptance and is served in almost</p>
        <p>all parts of the world. Several dishes from certain countries and ethnic groups have become popular as common dishes in different parts of the world and with time have received global acceptance. Indian, Italian and Chinese cuisines are examples of cuisines that have received global acceptance. Increasing globalization has made it possible for ingredients previously associated with specific regions and countries to be available all over the world, and hence made it possible for dishes associated with certain areas to be easily prepared in other parts of the world. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ethnic cuisines aid in the preservation of the cultural identity associated with specific ethnic groups. According to Kwon (2015, p.1), people from different ethnic groups are usually willing to share information on the preparation of their local dishes. Local ethnic dishes are usually related to the history and development of a certain ethnic group, and hence the popularity of a local dish associated with a certain ethnic group aids in the preservation of the history of the ethnic group. Ethnic cuisines also aid in the development of the food industry in their respective countries. Certain countries have a wide variety of dishes as a result of the availability of a wide range of ethnic dishes. This promotes the trade of key ingredients across the nation and enriches the list of available dishes for residents and visitors of a country. Due to the focus on cultural differences today, Kwon (2015, p.1) also notes that ethnic cuisines are receiving more attention today, as people seek to discover the cultural foods associated with different people across the world. On the downside, ethnic cuisines are the result of the availability of specific ingredients&nbsp;that may not be available in different parts of the world. As opposed to global and national cuisines, ethnic cuisines may not be easily developed in different parts of the world, due to the possibility that ingredients may not be available.</p>
        <p>National cuisines are advantages to the people of a specific nation as they can be easily prepared due to the ease of availability of required ingredients. As opposed to global cuisines that may require the use of certain ingredients that may be unavailable, national cuisines can be easily prepared at a lower cost, and are acceptable to the majority of people in a particular country. The preparation of national cuisines also aids in the setting of global standards in the culinary industry (Ferguson, 2010, p.106). Specific procedures and processes used in the preparation of certain national cuisines in different countries usually end up being accepted as formal culinary practices in other parts of the world, and with time become common practice. For example, French culinary practices have gained wide popularity in different parts of the world (Ferguson, 2010, p.106). Global cuisines, on the other hand, are advantageous to people in different parts of the world, as they aid in enriching the available menu. Additionally, global cuisines provide people in different parts of the world an opportunity to find out certain aspects of the culture of people in different parts of the world. On the downside, the availability of global cuisines in different parts of the world depends on the availability of key ingredients, which may not be readily available and may imply additional expenses in procurement.</p>
