    <div class="mavitu" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>Warren Buffet is widely regarded as one of the most prolific investors in the world and has consistently been ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the world. Buffet is usually associated with the Berkshire Hathaway Corporation, his first and most significant investment, which forms a holding company that controls a diversified investment portfolio of companies in different industries. Buffet was born in 1930, and developed a keen interest in investing in his teenage years, eventually enrolling in several top business schools in the country (Chaparro, 2017). His initial investment in Berkshire Hathaway was in 1962, after he bought some of the securities of the company, finally ending up acquiring controlling stakes in the company in 1964, alongside his longtime friend and partner Charlie Munger (Chaparro, 2017). Buffet&rsquo;s success in investment and business is mostly associated with his philosophies and leadership styles that are considered by many to be unique to him. Buffet has openly questioned the accuracy of age-old investment strategies and methods, choosing instead to advocate for value investing and active management. This paper analyzes Warren Buffet&rsquo;s investment philosophies in light of what he has been able to achieve so far and proposes lessons that can be learned from his business decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Investment And Business Philosophies</strong></p>
        <p>Buffet has been very vocal in his belief that the efficient market hypothesis analysis of the securities market is inaccurate (McGregor, 2015). According to the efficient market hypothesis, possessing the right information at the right time determines how successful an investment is going to be in the long run. Investors who have more information regarding a specific company or security are therefore able to make better decisions according to the hypothesis. According to Buffet, that is not practical. Instead, Buffet has advocated for the value</p>
        <p>investing method of analyzing securities in the exchange market. This technique involves carefully following movements in the values of different stocks on the market and identifying those whose values are significantly lower than their real worth. After purchasing a portfolio of undervalued stock, an investor then waits for their actual value to be attained at some point in future and makes gains in the incremental value of the investment.</p>
        <p>Buffet is credited with practicing a strict form of value investing. Instead of analyzing the market forces of supply and demand in the short run after purchasing undervalued stock, he chooses not to interpret any movements of security prices (Schifrin, 2013). He states that the securities market in the short term has no significant change that can affect his overall portfolio. His focus is on the long-term prices that he believes will reflect the real value of the securities purchased while undervalued (Chaparro, 2017). His selection of suitable securities to buy is determined by the underlying potential of the investment target to grow in future and increase the values of its securities. Unlike most investors, he does not purchase securities for sale at a future date when their values rise (Bloomberg News, 2015). Instead, he invests in companies that have a high-profit potential and can grow their earnings in future. Using his philosophy, Buffet has overseen the acquisition of multiple undervalued firms as subsidiaries of the Berkshire Hathaway Corporation, which currently has controlling interests several companies in different industries, including building products, clothing, real estate and flight services.</p>
        <p>Buffet believes that a business is more important than the people who work for it. It is more than the sum total of the all its employees and the efforts that they put in daily in the business. Employees who have in an interest in the future performance of the company are therefore more preferable. He points out that it is more important to find people who are genuinely interested in being a part of the business than people who are in it merely for the gains (Bloomberg News, 2015).&nbsp; Buffet also states that he does not believe in giving the board of directors of his company protection on the decisions they make as far as it affects the shareholders (Lowenstein, 2015). He also does not advocate for paying directors vast sums of money as is popular in other large organizations nowadays (Lowenstein, 2015). In the design of the internal managerial structure of the company, Buffet believes the chief executive officer should not double up as the chairman of the board, a situation that is also quite popular in most other companies (Lowenstein, 2015). To check the integrity of each other, the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer should be different people.</p>
        <p>Buffet and the Berkshire Hathaway organization have also become synonymous with what is termed as the ABC&rdquo;s of a business organization regarding effective leadership. According to Buffet, most business organizations that are performing well at some point end up in failing as a result of Arrogance, Bureaucracy, and Complacency (McGugan, 2015). According to Buffet (2009), with time organizational managers may become arrogant and look out for their interests instead of those of the company. In the end, this results in diminished performance and the failure of a business altogether. Buffet also states that bureaucracy within a company creates may stifle innovation, and slow the growth of a business organization (McGugan, 2015). Complacency occurs when an organization has achieved some success, after which managers&rsquo; focus on maintaining that success instead of looking for more. Managers who are complacent are not innovative and do not actively look for ways of improving the performance of a their companies, instead, they focus on how effective strategies already implemented have been and therefore fail to identify new ways through which they can drive growth within the company.</p>
        <p>Warren Buffet terms the three as the ABC&rsquo;s of business failure and believes they should be avoided at all costs.</p>
        <p><strong>Considerations When Selecting Investment Targets</strong></p>
        <p>When selecting an investment target, one of the crucial considerations made by Warren Buffet is the historical performance of the company (Buffett, 2009). The target company&rsquo;s performance in previous years as measured by its return on equity is used as a means of predicting its future performance. This was the case as pointed out by Buffet (2009) in the acquisition of Geico. Buffet had been keenly following the company&rsquo;s stock value since his college days and its returns, before finally deciding to purchase it (Buffett, 2009). Secondly, another critical consideration is the capital structure of the target company as measured by its debt to equity proportion. Highly levered firms that do not have an expected high-profit performance in future do not qualify as attractive investment targets. Another critical consideration is the actual profit margin being realized by the targeted company in comparison to other companies within the same industry. A growing company should be able to increase its profit margin from year to year as an indicator of its potential. Buffet also considers how long a company has been listed as a way of determining if indeed it is undervalued (Buffett, 2009). Companies that have not been on the securities market for the last ten years cannot be suitably evaluated due to insufficient information. Ten years as the lower limit provides information that can be used to determine if the company is indeed undervalued and is, therefore, an attractive investment target. Investing in relatively new companies may involve more risk and there is no clear pattern of their performance, and its therefore difficult to determine whether they are capable of achieving more growth in future or not. The previous performance of a company enable one know the exact challenges they faced previously and whether they were able to successfully overcome them. The level of differentiation of a company&rsquo;s product from those of competitors in the market is also an indicator of its future performance. Companies that have highly differentiated products are more likely to increase their brand value as they grow their market share over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Approaches To Managing People</strong></p>
        <p>Warren Buffet is widely recognized for his leadership skills. He is credited with the development of the &ldquo;Berkshire System,&rdquo; a management style that encourages employees to stay innovative by giving them as much autonomy as possible in their work (Lowenstein, 2015). Buffet&rsquo;s investment strategy involves purchasing already established organizations that have been in operation for a minimum of ten years. After an acquisition, Buffet rarely changes the management of the business, but instead corporates closely with current management structures and provides them with opportunities to grow the business based on their ideas. This is in line with Kouzes &amp; Posner (2017) leadership strategies that advocate for enabling others to act as a way of improving internal organizational efficiency. By giving his managers autonomy on how to run the company&rsquo;s they manage, Buffet taps into their expertise and provides them with enough room to be as innovative as possible, as they look for ways to grow their businesses. This managerial technique is useful in the long run, as it allows a manager to learn from their mistakes and over time improve their performance (Lowenstein, 2015). A contrary administrative model would require that the ownership of a business be involved in decision making when crucial decisions are on the line. There is no guarantee however that this model is more efficient than Buffet&rsquo;s, as problems may still occur where the owner is not sufficiently experienced in matters relating to the business operations. Even in cases where owners work closely with managers, decisions can still be made that aren&rsquo;t in the best interests of business, leading to loses in future.</p>
        <p>In the past, Buffet has faced some challenges as a result of giving his managers autonomy on how to run the units they manage. In one instance, a manager invested heavily in a company being targeted for acquisition by Buffet, then recommended it be purchased (Lowenstein, 2015). Buffet though has maintained that alternative managerial structures may also face integrity problems from time to time and has chosen to stick to his model of managing people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In addition to giving his managers autonomy on how they wish to run their companies, Buffet also ensures that bureaucracy within his new businesses is wholly eliminated (McGregor, 2015). Primarily Buffet's entrusts the management of a whole company to one person and puts in place measures that ensure that the selected person is at liberty to run the business as he wishes. Most departments that are usually involved in decision making in other companies such as legal departments, communications departments are typically absent in Buffet&rsquo;s organizations. Instead, Buffet&rsquo;s goal is often to identify the most reliable person to run a company, and then give them autonomy on how exactly they are going to run the business. When determining the most trustworthy person to entrust with the management of a business, Buffet believes a person&rsquo;s character is the most critical consideration. According to McGregor (2015), the ideal character traits to look for in a manager is their decisiveness, rationality and their ability to deal with pressure in the course of their work. Passion for the business come in second. Buffet does not believe managers who are mainly interested in substantial pay packages can survive in his organizations. He prefers managers who are genuinely interested in their work and do their best to grow their companies. This is also in line with Daft&rsquo;s (2016) proposition on the importance of organization culture in the success and growth of a business. Buffet clearlyt prefers having managers who creat a culture of growth within their companies and continously look for ways through which they can improve revenues and increase their market share. This is important for the long terms success of an organization and enables Buffet focus less on each individual business as each manager does their best to improve the specifi company they are managing.</p>
        <p><strong>What Can Be learned From Warren Buffet&rsquo;s Approach To Business</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren Buffet&rsquo;s approach to business is quite practical and simple to understand. Most of his philosophies are easily applicable in the day to day running of different business organizations. The elimination of bureaucracy in the running of business organizations is an efficient way of encouraging employees to be more innovative in their work and undoubtedly result in the growth of a business organization in the long run. This is in line with Daft&rsquo;s &nbsp;(2016), proposition that overtime, good organization cultures result in growth. Secondly, Buffet advocates for the recruitment of passionate people who value the business more than what they get out of it (Buffett, 2009). This makes a lot of sense and is applicable in all areas of business. Focus on the core functions of a company by its employees is an efficient way of ensuring everyone is working towards the same goals and objectives. Managers who are passionate about their work are more productive and achieve more in the long run than those who are mainly motivated by their gains from the organization. Buffet&rsquo;s proposition that managers should never get complacent but should keep working on how to improve the business even after achieving success is also applicable to all business organizations, as complacency reduces creativity and innovation.</p>
        <p>Buffet&rsquo;s investment model can also be used in the evaluation of investment opportunities in the exchange market. Just like Buffet, the analysis of viable investment decisions should use a criteria that analyzes the previous performance of the company and its potential for growth in future as indicated by its ability to drive growth in its past years. &nbsp;Instead of focusing on the short-term returns on investment, it is advisable to focus on the long-term growth that can be achieved on a security in the market after the identification of undervalued securities. This requires careful analysis of the historical movements of targeted securities before making a purchase decision. As a result, securities that are currently popular may not be the most attractive in the long run, as they may be either overvalued or valued at the right amounts. To invest optimally in the exchange market, buyers should be more interested in securities that are undervalued, as their value will significantly appreciate in future and result in gains both in the value of the securities and the earning attributed to them.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
        <p>Warren Buffets career in investment and management spans over fifty years, during which he has developed one of the most sophisticated portfolios of investments in the world (Chaparro, 2017). Through the holding company Berkshire Hathaway, Buffet has invested in multiple industries and has developed a unique management style attributable only to him. His investment strategy is a bit different from the most popular ones, he goes for undervalued stock, purchases the whole company and waits for its value to increase in the long term. This has seen him acquire numerous companies in different industries and make substantial gains over time. Buffet is also recognized for his unique managerial style that is entirely different from that of most other corporations. His approach to management involves identifying the right people for the job, then giving them complete autonomy on how they are to going to go about leading their organizations. Hiring only passionate people, Buffet encourages his people to seek ways of improving their companies continuously and to keep innovating even after finding success in one way or another. Most of Buffet&rsquo;s philosophies are highly practical in everyday business management and can be very useful when practiced correctly.</p>
